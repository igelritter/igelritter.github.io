        <h1>Still Figuring Things out</h1>

<p>This is an experiment at the moment. The idea is to put together a tech blog where I can talk about things that I've worked on, current projects, and just general things of interest. Bear with me as I bring this up to speed. </p>

<h2>About me</h2>

<p>I've been working in computer engineering since 2005. I started out in entry level support positions and worked up to Sr. Network Design engineer at T-Mobile USA before coming to Berlin. For several years, I've wanted to switch tracks from designing networks, system admin, and voice over IP technologies, to software development. And now, I'm working on that. You can find my full resume <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/walter-phippeny/12/12a/54a">here</a> and <a href="https://www.xing.com/profile/Walter_PHIPPENY">here</a>.   </p>
